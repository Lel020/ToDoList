1. Start out by making an input screen within the centre of the page.
   It will only be 1 page initially, but keep growing as the user adds more and more items.

2. Output will go on top of the input screen, and will be listing downwards from the top-left.
   Once the max number of items is reached, the items will be on the following column. I feel like
   limiting the columns to maybe 3 or 4.

3. Add a button named 'ENTER' to the bottom of the input screen. This will add the item to the
   output screen.

4. Add a button named 'DELETE' to the bottom of the input screen. This will delete the last item.

5. Add a button named 'CLEAR' to the bottom of the input screen. This will clear the entire list.
